The create_shared_mailbox script is designed to create a new shared mailbox within the Exchange Online shell. To use this script enter the information needed in to the variables area (#Enter Shared Mailbox region). The script works best running by region rather than in it's entirety. 

Optional Regions
The optional regions allow you to set SendAs permissions and set an ownerof the mailbox respectively.
